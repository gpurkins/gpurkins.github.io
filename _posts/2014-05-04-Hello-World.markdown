 I haven't written much about thoughts on automation and people always ask. Most of the automation I create comes from me being incredibly lazy, or stupid. Computers are great at doing things over and over, and humans are generally terrible and mistake prone at it. At least I am. I like making tools and designing process for software development to make life easier for the poor humans that have to put up with computers.

Here I'll document some of my exciting stunts to do more work in less time. Hope you like vagrant, puppet, and git. 

Thanks for all the fish [github][jekyll].
