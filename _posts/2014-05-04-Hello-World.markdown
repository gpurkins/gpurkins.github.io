I've always wanted to write more about devops, products, and my thoughts on automation. Most of the automation I create comes from being incredibly lazy, or stupid. Computers are great at doing things over and over, and humans are generally terrible and mistake prone at it. At least I am. I like making tools and designing process for software development to make life easier for the poor humans that have to put up with computers.

Here's I'll document some of my exciting stunts to do less work in more time. Hope you like vagrant, puppet, and git. Maybe with a sprinkle of full stack integration testing, or even some takes on testing problems.

Thanks for all the fish [github][jekyll].
